### A computer game of the ages
This is a fangame of [Oddwarg Animal RPG](http://oddwarg.com/index.php?id=OARPG), a Game Maker game from 2003.

At this point, the game is very early in development. I am just figuring out how best to use my tools.

Please install [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) to run and build the project. You will need a plugin to encode / decode mp3. On my mac I installed sox using brew and it seemed to include this. On Windows you will need to copy [libmp3lame](https://www.rarewares.org/mp3-lame-libraries.php) somewhere. The Dockerfile also demonstrates the dependencies necessary to build and run the project.
