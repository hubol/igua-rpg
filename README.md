### A computer game of the ages
Please install sox (http://sox.sourceforge.net/) to run and build the project. You will need a plugin to encode / decode mp3. I installed sox using brew and it seemed to include this. On windows you will need to copy libmp3lame (https://www.rarewares.org/mp3-lame-libraries.php) somewhere.
